# ruby based terminal app
this app is created to be play ground for ruby language and play around with programming with it and it is under MIT license.
use this code for any purpose related to ruby education.
i am making this project because i love ruby and it is by far the best programming language for backend development if it was possible i think i will build some integration for ruby with javascript/typescript ecosystem because i think having ruby in front will be a game changer.
- first of all ruby must be supported by different communities like javascript/typescript does.
- the syntax and its code is very clean if we could some how use it on frameworks like react, next.js, and others
- the syntax of ruby is on of the benefits from it but that is not the only thing i discover by using ruby, It is fast i have some habit that i will test languages or run time environments like node js by using them tass like writing a json file like i am counting the json file as a database, "at list i think like that!" and i give them a task like writing a file for some 1-10 million in ruby case up to 100 million types by using for loops and generating some schema like user data and write it on specific JSON file.
- the first time i check ruby believe i was amazed by the result!
